Use it for free, pay if you get paid. If you make a commercial product with this extension included (e.g. getting paid from a client who wants to have a website made of this product), then I would kindly ask you to give a small financial support for about 5 USD to keep this project floating around the world wide web.

You have the right to determine the price of your project without any interference from me. You may be able to discuss this additional cost with your client, honestly, without the need to keep anything confidential. I want everything to be transparent so that no one feels aggrieved.

Note: If you are from Indonesia and are having problems with the current rupiah exchange rate against the dollar, you are allowed to consider 5 USD as 50,000 IDR.

Thank you üíïÔ∏è
